# NandToTetris - Project 7 - VMTranslator in NodeJS

Project has been built during course [NandToTetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)!
The VMTranslator allows us to translate commands language code into Assembly Language.

# Usage

For sure feel free to get this code and use it for yourself. I'd like to explain you how to use the VMTranslator.

1.  After clone this repository on your machine, you can use one of the programs which are into directors MemoryAccess and StackArithmetic.
2.  Open your terminal and use that command:

    $ node vmtranslator <entire/path/of/your/file.vm>

3.  Open input file directory and there you should get a file.asm - this file is ready to use by CPUEmulator.sh
